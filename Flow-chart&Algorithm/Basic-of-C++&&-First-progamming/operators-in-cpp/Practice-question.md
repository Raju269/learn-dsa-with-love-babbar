# ðŸ”¹ 1. Unary Operators (++, --, !)
1. Show the difference between pre-increment (++x) and post-increment (x++) in a loop.

Use a unary operator to reverse the sign of a number.

Use the ! (logical NOT) operator to check if a number is zero.

Predict output:

cpp
Copy
Edit
int x = 5; 
cout << x++ + ++x;
